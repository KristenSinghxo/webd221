			<h2>Mentor</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>	My mentor, Mrs. Celine Carrier is Fluvanna County High and Middle School's psychologist.She earned her  Bachelors and Master of Education Degree in Counseling at Notre Dame College in 1995, and her Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies in Fitchburg, Massachusetts' State University in 2004. She is a part of the Who's Who Among America's Teachers' program and has earned awards for her works. She came to Virginia and now works in the high school and middle school and works to identify and help children in the school system to get the care they need by setting them up in a hospital or by counseling students.</p>
			<

			<p>	Mrs. Carrier helped me immensely with my paper for she was able to keep me away from bias. When I leaned toward one side, she helped me understand the other and how both are necessary toward development. She helped me understand my points and give me both sides of the debate which resulted in her helping me understand and write my conclusion.</p>

			<p>	  I would like to thank her for all the time she gave me and my internship, for all the help and advice, and for all the fun talks together. Most importantly, I thank her for offering to be my mentor when I came to her for help! </p>
